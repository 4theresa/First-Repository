# A bit about Theresa
Back in college the first time, I was the only girl in my class to take computer courses.  Marriage interrupted me from getting my degree.  So about 29 years later I went back to university to finish my computer science degree at IU Bloomington.  My oldest son went on to get his BS and Masters with Honors at the same university at age 19. We took several classes together as the oldest and youngest students in the classes.  But a growing business, First Class Window Cleaning Inc, prevented me from finishing my degree...again!

## Hobbies
Surprise...flowers!  Sewing, Paper Sculpture, building high end guitars, attained my Master Woodworking degree and do various other unconventional wood art, watercolor painting and developer for a little MMO from way back called A Tale in the Desert.  Currently relearning C and C++ along with learning to use GitHub.
